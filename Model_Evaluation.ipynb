    "# Model Evaluation\n",
    "- Previously we had discussed about In-sample evaluation. Tells us how or model will fit the data used to train it.\n",
    "- Problem: It does not tell us how the trained model can be used to predict new data.\n",
    "- But in real world we will be given a new data set which we have not seen before. We need to know how our model will perform on this new data.\n",
    "- Solution: We can use `train_test_split()` function from `sklearn.model_selection` library to split the data into training and testing data.\n",
    "- It divides the data into `training set` or `In-Sample data` and `testing set` or `Out-of-sample data`.\n",
    "- When we split our dataset, usually the larger portion of the dataset is used for `training` and smaller part is used for `testing`."
