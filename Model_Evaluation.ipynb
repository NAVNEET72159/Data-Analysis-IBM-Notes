    "# Generalization Error\n",
    "- Generalization error is the error that results from using a model to predict new data.\n",
    "- It is calculated by comparing the predicted values with the actual values.\n",
    "- The smaller the difference between the predicted and actual values, the lower the generalization error.\n",
    "- Generalization error is also known as `out-of-sample error`.\n",
    "- The goal of any model is to have the lowest possible generalization error.\n",
    "- Using a lot of data for training and testing will help us to achieve this goal.\n",
    "- For example, let's say we take a random sample of the data using 90% of the data for training and 10% for testing.\n",
    "    - The first time we experiment we get a good estimate of the training data.\n",
    "    - If we experiment again, training the model with a different combination of samples, we also get a good result, but the results will be different relative to the first time we run the experiment.\n",
    "    - Repeating the experiment again with a different combination of training and testing samples, the results are relatively close to the Generalization error, but distinct from each other.\n",
    "    - Repeating the process, we get good approximation of the generalization error, but the precision is poor i.e., all the results are extremely different from one another.\n",
    "    - If we use fewer data points to train the model and more to test the model, the accuracy of the generalization performance will be less, but the model will have good precision.\n",
    "    - If we use more data points to train the model and less to test the model, the accuracy of the generalization performance will be high, but the model will have poor precision.\n",
    "    - To overcome this problem, we use `cross validation`.\n",
    "        - It is one of the most common `out-of-sample evaluation metrics`.\n",
    "        - In this method, the dataset is split into k-equal groups; each group is referred to as a fold.\n",
    "        - For example 4 folds.\n",
    "        - Some of the folds can be used as a training set, which we use to train the model, and the remaining parts are used as a test set, which we use to test the model.\n",
    "        - For example, we can use three folds for training; then use one fold for testing.\n",
    "        - This is repeated until each partition is used for both training and testing.\n",
    "        - At the end, we use the average results as the estimate of `out-of-sample error`.\n",
    "        - The advantage of this method is that it matters less how the training and testing sets are partitioned.\n",
    "        - The disadvantage of this method is that it is more computationally expensive than train/test split.\n",
    "- The Simplest way to apply cross validation is to call the `cross_val_score()` function, which performs multiple `out-of-sample` evaluations.\n",
